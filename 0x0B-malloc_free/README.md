The malloc function in C is used for dynamic memory allocation. It stands for "memory allocation" and is part of the <stdlib.h> header. The malloc function allocates a specified number of bytes of memory and returns a pointer to the beginning of that block of memory.

Here's the basic syntax of malloc:

c
Copy code
#include <stdlib.h>

void *malloc(size_t size);
size: The number of bytes to allocate.

Returns: A pointer to the beginning of the allocated memory, or NULL if the allocation fails.
