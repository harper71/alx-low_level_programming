my task on static libary

A static library, also known as a "archive" or ".lib" file on Windows or ".a" file on Unix-based systems, is a collection of compiled object files that are linked directly into a program at compile time. Unlike dynamic libraries, which are linked at runtime, static libraries are incorporated into the final executable during the compilation process.

Here's a brief overview of how static libraries work and how to create and use them:

How Static Libraries Work:
Compilation:

Source code files (e.g., .c or .cpp) are compiled into object files (.o or .obj). Each source file is compiled separately.
Archiving:

The compiled object files are bundled together into a single archive file using a tool like ar on Unix-based systems or directly through the compiler on some platforms.
Linking:

When you compile a program, the linker includes the necessary object files from the static library directly into the executable. This means that the functions and code from the library become part of the final executable.
How to Create a Static Library:

Compile Source Files:

gcc -c file1.c file2.c file3.c
Create Archive:

ar rcs libexample.a file1.o file2.o file3.o
How to Use a Static Library:
Include Header Files:

Include the necessary header files in your source code to declare the functions and structures provided by the library.
Link with the Library:
Specify the library to be linked during the compilation process.
On Unix-based systems:
gcc -o myprogram myprogram.c -lexample -L/path/to/library
